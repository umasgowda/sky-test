#Parental Control Service
##Scenario
Sky is developing a next generation Video on Demand platform. You are part of a software engineering team, developing  
services for the platform and working on the story below.
**Prevent access to movies based on parental control level**
*As a customer I don’t want my account to be able to access movies that have a higher parental control level than my 
current preference setting.*

Your team has partnered with the Movie Meta Data team that provides a service that can return parental control 
information for a given movie.

##Instructions
You are required to provide an implementation of a *ParentalControlService*. You may use Java version 6 or above.
The service should accept as input the customer’s *parental control level preference* and a *movie id*. If the customer 
is able to watch the movie the *ParentalControlService* should indicate this to the calling client.

Please implement the *ParentalControlService* API.

The recommended time to complete this exercise should be between forty-five minutes and one-hour.

##Parental Control Levels
U, PG, 12, 15, 18
Where U is the least restrictive and 18 is the most restrictive.

##Movie Service
The Movie Meta Data team is currently developing the MovieService getParentalControlLevel call that accepts the 
*movie id* as an input and returns the parental control level for that movie as a string.
This is a simple diagram of the interaction between the services:

###MovieService Interface
```java
package com.thirdparty.movie;

public interface MovieService {
    String getParentalControlLevel(String movieId) throws TitleNotFoundException, TechnicalFailureException;
}
```

This is a third party interface so you should not change it. The exceptions are checked exceptions.

##Acceptance Criteria

The following table describes the expected ParentalControlService result based on a given MovieService 
*getParentalControlLevel* response.
 
|MovieService getParentalControlLevel response|Description        |ParentalControlService result                       |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|Parental Control level                       |A string e.g. “PG” |If the parental control level of the movie is equal to or less than the customer’s preference indicate to the caller that the customer can watch the movie |
|TitleNotFound exception                      |The movie service could not find the given movie|Indicate the error to the calling client.|
|Technical failure exception                  |System error       |Indicate that the customer cannot watch this movie  |

We need to ensure that we always failsafe.

##What we look at
*We are interested in code readability and structure and your use of best practice.
*Please supply us with your source code in a single archive. The project should be self-contained.
*The name of the root folder in the archive should contain your full name.
*Please do not publish your solution in the public domain e.g. GitHub or a blog
